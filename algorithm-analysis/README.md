# Introduction
This module includes the AlgorithmAnalysisService, which serves as the core analysis engine, processing batches of video frames or uploaded images through machine learning algorithms. 
Deployed on GPU-enabled infrastructure (Nvidia T4 GPUs), it extracts structured metadata and object attributes, returning standardized JSON responses. 
Analysis results are published to a Kafka cluster for asynchronous processing and service decoupling. 
The AlgorithmAnalysisService supports Object Detection Attributes:
- Person: Age estimation, gender classification, height approximation, clothing colors (upper/lower garments), body size classification
- Vehicle: License plate recognition, color identification, brand classification, seatbelt compliance detection
- Motorcycle: Age estimation, gender classification, height approximation, clothing colors (upper/lower garments), body size classification, helmet compliance detection
- Bicycle: Age estimation, gender classification, height approximation, upper clothing color, lower bike color
